The >200 SLOC customizal fully cross platform inter planetary prompt without a line of shell script!

# ok , here at the features
----------

* less than 200 SLOC
* compiles to a ~4.5 MB binary (5.456 MB actually)
* customize with a simple YAML file defing prompt params. Seriously , here's mine:
```yml
prompt:
  symbol: "â–²"
  showOs: false
  truncateDirs: true
  style: plaintext
```
* writen in go and so can compile for **ANY** platform 

* supports all *major* OS's

* can't get it to work for your shell? it's not very difficult to get it to work for starship's init system
